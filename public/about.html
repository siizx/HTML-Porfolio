<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello!<br />
  I'm Andrea, a Computer Science Student at Unige (Universita' di Genova).<br />
  This will be my Web Development portfolio, I'll try to keep this up to date with all my projects.<br />
  At the moment I'm studying:
  <ul>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
    <li>Networking (The basics)</li>
    <li>Calculus</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JS</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>And much more! ... Probably too much actually, but it's fine.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
I like programming, and although I haven't been practicing anything lately, i also love BJJ, Grappling and weightlifting.
I really should start training again...
</p>

<p>
  I can't wait to graduate (if i ever do), and finally get a job i like!
